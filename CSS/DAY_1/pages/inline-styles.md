# Inline Styles
Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it’s possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles.

To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you’d like applied to that element.

### Example
```
<p style='color: red;'>I'm learning to code!</p>
```


If you’d like to add more than one style with inline styles, simply keep adding to the style attribute. Make sure to end the styles with a semicolon (;).

### Example
```
<p style='color: red; font-size: 20px;'>I'm learning to code!</p>
```

It’s important to know that inline styles are a quick way of directly styling an HTML element, but are rarely used when creating websites.
