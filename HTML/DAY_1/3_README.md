# The Body
One of the key HTML elements we use to build a webpage is the body element. Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen. Here’s what opening and closing body tags look like:
```
<body>

</body>
```

Once the file has a body, many different types of content – including text, images, and buttons – can be added to the body.
```
<body>
  <p>What's up, doc?</p>
</body>
```

### Instructions
* Add a body to your web page using the  `<body>` element.
* Add the following code between your opening and closing body tags:
```
<p>"Life is very short and what we have to do must be done in the now." - Audre Lorde</p>
```

### Questions
* What is a web browser?
* Why does content outside the body still display?
