# Opening Links in a New Window
The `target` attribute specifies how a link should open.

Itâ€™s possible that one or more links on your web page link to an entirely different website. In that case, you may want users to read the linked website, but hope that they return to your web page. This is exactly when the target attribute is useful!

For a link to open in a new window, the `target` attribute requires a value of _blank. The `target` attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the `href` attribute.

```
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>
```

In the example above, setting the `target` attribute to "`_blank`" instructs the browser to open the relevant Wikipedia page in a new window.

### Questions
* Do attributes need to be in a specific order?
* This exercise uses the `_blank` value to open pages in new tabs. Does the target attribute have other values?
