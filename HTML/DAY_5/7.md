# Audio and Attributes
The `<audio> `element is used to embed audio content into a document. Like `<video>`, `<audio>` uses `src` to link the audio source.

```
<audio>
  <source src="iAmAnAudioFile.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>
```

We linked our audio file into the browser but now we need to give it controls. This is where attributes come in. Attributes provide additional information about an element.

Attributes allow us to do many different things to our audio file. There are many attributes for `<audio>` but today weâ€™re going to be focusing on `controls` and `src`.

* `controls`: automatically displays the audio controls into the browser such as play and mute.
* `src`: specifies the URL of the audio file.

          Dogs have a sense of time. It's been proven that they know the difference between a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can predict future events, such as regular walk times.

* In the code editor, create an `<audio>` tag with the attribute `controls` directly under the commented line.
* Add a source for the audio inside the `<audio>` tag by using this code:

```
<source src="" type="audio/mp3">

Use the following URL as the source for the audio: `https://content.codecademy.com/courses/SemanticHTML/dogBarking.mp3`

```
