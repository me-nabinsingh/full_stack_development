# Article and Section
`<section>` defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. For example, content with the same theme such as articles about cricket can go under a single `<section>`. A websiteâ€™s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.

Here is an example of how to use `<section>`:

```
<section>
  <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2> 
</section>

```
In the code above we created a `<section>` element to encapsulate the code. In `<section>` we added a `<h2>` element as a heading.


The `<article>` element holds content that makes sense on its own. `<article>` can hold content such as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. An `<article>` tag would help someone using a screen reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text, images, audio, etc.) begins and ends.


Here is an example of how to use <article>:

```
<section>
  <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2>
  <article>
    <p>A single match of cricket can last up to 5 days.</p>
  </article>
</section>

```

In the code above, the `<article>` element containing a fact about cricket was placed inside of the `<section>` element. It is important to note that a `<section>` element could also be placed in an `<article>` element depending on the context.

* In the code find and replace `<div id="section">` with `<section>` and replace the corresponding closing `</div>` with a closing `</section>`.
* Now encapsulate the `<h2>` and `<p>` tag with `<article>`.
