# Figure and Figcaption

`<figure>` is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc, which is referenced in the main flow of the document.

```
<figure>
  <img src="overwatch.jpg">
</figure>
```

In this code, we created a `<figure>` element so that we can encapsulate our `<img>` tag. In `<figure>` we used the `<img>` tag to insert an image onto the webpage. We used the src attribute within the `<img>` tag so that we can link the source of the image.

Itâ€™s possible to add a caption to the image by using `<figcaption>`.

`<figcaption> `is an element used to describe the media in the `<figure>` tag. Usually, `<figcaption>` will go inside `<figure>`. This is different than using a `<p>` element to describe the content; if we decide to change the location of `<figure>`, the paragraph tag may get displaced from the figure while a `<figcaption>` will move with the figure. This is useful for grouping an image with a caption.


```
<figure>
  <img src="overwatch.jpg">
  <figcaption>This picture shows characters from Overwatch.</figcaption>
</figure>


```
