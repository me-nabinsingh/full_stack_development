# Video and Embed
The `<video>` element makes it clear that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user.

Some attributes that can alter a video playback include:

* `controls`: When added in, a play/pause button will be added onto the video along with volume control and a fullscreen option.
* `autoplay`: The attribute which results in a video automatically playing as soon as the page is loaded.
* `loop`: This attribute results in the video continuously playing on repeat.

Below is an example of `<video>` being used with the controls attribute:

```
<video src="coding.mp4" controls>Video not supported</video>

```

Another tag that can be used to incorporate media content into a page is the `<embed>` tag, which can embed any media content including videos, audio files, and gifs from an external source. This means that websites that have an embed button have some form of media content that can be added to other websites. The `<embed> `tag is a self-closing tag, unlike the `<video> `element. Note that `<embed> `is a deprecated tag and other alternatives, such as `<video>`, `<audio`> and `<img>`, should be used in its place, but is being taught for legacy purposes.


Below weâ€™ll take a look at `<embed>` being used in action.

```
<embed src="download.gif"/>

```

          Dogs have a sense of time. It's been proven that they know the difference between a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can predict future events, such as regular walk times.

* Add the following video URL with the attribute `controls` and wrap it in an opening and closing `video` tag.
```
dog-video.mp4
```
 In between the opening and closing <video> tag, you can add a text that will show up if the video is unable to load. This text is helpful for screen readers as well!

* Add the following gif into your code using the `<embed>` tag and the src attribute:
